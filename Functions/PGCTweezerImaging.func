% This requires at least 7ms before this function is called
% the actual imaging time is t_twz_imaging, the 7ms is the time for the shutter to turn on
% the camera is exposed for t_twz_imaging time in total
% also note that this function advance the time by t_twz_imagingms, and the camera shutter will be completely closed
